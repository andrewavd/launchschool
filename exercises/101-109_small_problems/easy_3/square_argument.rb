# Squaring an argument

# Using the multiply method from "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write
# a method that computes the square of its argument ( the square is the 
# result of multiplying a number by itself).

# Further exploration
# What if we wanted to generalize this method t a "power to the n" type
# method: cubed, to the 4th power, to the 5th, etc. How would we go about
# doing so while still using the multiply method?

def multiply(num, num)
  num1 * num2
end

def square(num, power)
  multiply(num, num))
end

puts square(2, 2)
puts square(-8, 2)
