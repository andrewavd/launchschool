Step 1: The "Problem"...
Write the initial problem as stated to you, don't make any changes, write it out verbatim.

A) The "Problem", uncensored:
B) Breakdown the problem into smaller components as to how you understand them:
C) Input/Output types and examples:
  Type(s):
  - Input type: array Output type: 'string'
  Example(s):
  1. Input: [1, 2, 3] Output: '1 2 3'
  2. Input: ['andy', 'holmes'] Output: 'andy holmes'

Step 2 - Test cases:
A) Happy Path
B) Edge Cases
   - input
   - emptiness ('', nil, [], {})
   - repetion/duplication
   - data types
C) Bad Input/Failures

Step 3 - Approach:
A) Written synopsis:
B) Data Structures:
   - Input data:
   - Rules/requirements data:
C) Algorithm:
D) Re-visit Step #2:
   - A solid understanding of the problem should have been developed by this point...
   - Are there any tests that need revision or need to be added due to keener insight?

Step 4: Let's code! Move steps 1, 2 and 3 to code.

Step 6: Test code:

Step 7: Refactor where possible:
