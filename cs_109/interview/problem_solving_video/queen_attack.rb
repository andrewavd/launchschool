# Step 1 - Problem write up.
# A) Original write up:
# In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or
# diagonal.
# So, if you're told the white queen is at (2, 3) and the black queen at (5, 6), then you'd
# know you've got a set-up like so:
# --------
# --------
# ---W----
# --------
# --------
# ------B-
# --------
# --------
# You'd also be able to answer whether the queens can attack each other. In this case, that
# answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.
