# Step 1 - The "Problem".

# A) Original write up or presentation:
# 

# B) Breakdown (Break it down as you understand it.):
# - 

# C) Input/Output types and examples: (2 minimum)
# Input type: integer Output type: 'string'
# Examples:
# Input: Output:
# Input: Output:

# Step 2 - Test cases:
# A) Happy Path
# B) Edge Cases
#   - input
#   - emptiness ('', nil, [], {})
#   - repetion/duplication
#   - data types
# C) Bad Input/Failures

# Step 3 - Approach: (Develop your algorithm.)
# Written synopsis:

# 2)

# Re-visit Step #2:
# A solid understanding of the problem should have been developed by this point...
# Are there any tests that need revision or need to be added due to keener insight?

# Step 4 - Let's code!

# Step 5 - Test code:

# Step 6 - Refactor:
