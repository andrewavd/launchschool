Problem:
Write a method that will take an array of numbers, and only return those that are primes.


Breakdown/rules:
Problem type/structure: Iterate through input array and `.select` those that return true from method `is_prime?()`.

- (x) Write a method to iterate through given array.
- (x) Use is_prime?() method from previous exercise.
- (x) Iterate through input array using .select.
- (x) is_prime? in block will determine true/false.

input: array
output/return: array of prime numbers from the input array
data structures:

algorithm:
1. step 1
2. step 2

tests:
() All tests should evaluate to true.
select_primes([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [2, 3]
select_primes([4, 6, 8, 10]) == []
