Problem:
Write a method that takes two numbers. It should print out all primes between the two numbers. Don't use Ruby's `prime` class.


Breakdown/rules:
- (x)Write a method. find_primes(num1, num2)
- (x)Find all the prime numbers in the given range inclusive.
- (x)Output the prime numbers in the given range.

input: two integers
output/return: nil
data structures:

algorithm:
1. iterate through the given range.
2. Write a second method, `is_prime?(num)` that returns a boolean true if the passed in argument is a prime and false if it is not.

tests:
() All tests should evaluate to true.
find_primes(3, 10) ==> 3, 5, 7
