*Problem:*
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

*Breakdown/rules:*
>> Problem type/structure: Array iteration. Comparison to a given value.

* Input: array of integers, integer
* Output/Return: array of integer(s)
* Data Structures:

- () Iterate through an array of integers, adding the current iteration to all the other individual elements to check if the sum to a target value.
- () return the indices of the elements that meet the criteria.
- ()

Algorithm(s):
1. step 1
2. step 2

*Tests:*
() All tests should evaluate to true. *Mark if output will be boolean test results.*
() Edge cases: *Mark & list if applicable.*

p two_sum([2, 7, 11, 15], 26)
