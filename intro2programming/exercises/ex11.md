# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

I don't believe any one source is "best". There are a number of sources that I frequent regularly...
They are:
1. http://ruby-doc.org/ Great site for just about anything you want to know regarding language constructs and functionality.

2. http://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html For many people using Ruby there is going to be a relationship with Rails, this is a great site for rails.

3. https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ Another solid Ruby site, particularly regarding setup and tweaking setup.

4. https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv I use rbenv as my version manager, this is where I go when I need help.

As has been alluded to in the LaunchSchool course material, mastery is a beneficial path that few embrace. It is easy to wander down the infinite number of "enlightening information" rabbit holes. Because of this constant siren's song of distraction, I consciously guard against the never ending search for the "best" sites for enlightenment. I'm always willing to entertain "better", but since I possess what already fits my needs, the burden of proof that something is better is relatively high with me.
