# Question 1
Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

It is often the case that two different things "look the dame", but they can be different objects. The "undrr the good" object referred to by a particular named_variable can change depending on wat is done to that named_variable.

In othe words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it is not always THE SAME object.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:
```ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block.

"

  1.times do
    a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
    b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
    c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
    d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

    puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the block and is: #{a_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the block and is: #{b_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the block and is: #{c_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the block and is: #{d_outer_inner_id} inside the block.

"

    a_outer = 22
    b_outer = "thirty three"
    c_outer = [44]
    d_outer = c_outer[0]

    puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after.

"


    a_inner = a_outer
    b_inner = b_outer
    c_inner = c_outer
    d_inner = c_inner[0]

    a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
    b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
    c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
    d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

    puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer).

"
  end

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the block.

"

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the block.

" rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
end
```
Solution:
There are no surprises here. Variables defined in the method are accessible throughout the method, including within the block, and as their values change their id's change. The variables defined within the block are no longer accessible outside the block.

# Question 2
Look at the object id's again from the perspective os a method call instead of a block.

Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the block/method. We simply took the contents of the block from the previous practice problem and moved it to a method, to which we are passing all of our outer variables.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

```ruby
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."

  an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)


  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
end


def an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)
  a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the method and is: #{a_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the method and is: #{b_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the method and is: #{c_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the method and is: #{d_outer.object_id} inside the method."

  a_outer = 22
  b_outer = "thirty three"
  c_outer = [44]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."


  a_inner = a_outer
  b_inner = b_outer
  c_inner = c_outer
  d_inner = c_inner[0]

  a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
  b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
  c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
  d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
end
```
Solution:
Again, no surprises. Variables created within the an_illustrative_method are not accessible outside of it and since no variables were passed back everything dies when we leave the method. So, even though the 'outer's were passed in and changed, they were not passed back and retain the values they were given, along with their corresponding id's, in fun_with_ids method.

# Question 3
Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

Study the following code and state what will be displayed... and why:
```ruby
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

Solution:
puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}" => "pumpkins"
my_string is passed to tricky_method and the value of my_string is assigned to a_string_param locally in tricky_method. At this point they both have the same object Id. += re-assigns the value of a_string_param and in doing so a new object id is assigned to a_string_param. my_string and a_string_param are no longer sharing the same object id so their values are different.

puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}" => ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]
This is a bit trikcier to understand. As far as passing to tricky_method; same as above, BUT an array can have multiple elements and when we append a new element using << Ruby continues to use the same object so the id does not change. my_array and an_array_param still share the same object id.

# Question 4
To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.

```ruby
def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```
Solution:
puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}" => "pumpkinsrutabaga"
<< does not re-assign it appends so a_string_param and my_string continue to share the same object id.

puts "My array looks like this nomw: #{my_array}" => ["pumpkins"]
an_array_param created a new array and in doing so changed the object id.
